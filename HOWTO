SquealIrcBot is design such that you never should have to extend the
SquealIrcBot class. Instead, you implement listeners that are triggered by
events, And the listeners can perform whatever actions as the bot. This allows
mixin systems, where potentially one Listener implementation can be used with
many bots.

A listener is any php object that implements methods of the form onName. The
name attribute corresponds to an event type that is triggered when the bot
performs or recieves certain actions. Listeners are executed in the order they
are loaded, and if a call to onName returns true, execution of the subsequent
loaders will not occur.

At the moment, these are the current actions:

Connect: When the bot connects to the IRC server
Disconnect: When the bot disconnects from the IRC server
Tick: Triggered at least every X milliseconds, where X is configurable
Raw: Reads the raw IRC lines from the server
Unknown: Catches any lines that are not recognized by the bot
Version: A CTCP Version request
Action: A CTCP Action
Ping: A CTCP Ping Request
Request: A CTCP Time Request
Finger: A CTCP Finger Request
Message: A user (Perhaps us) send a message to a channel
PrivMessage: A message was sent directly to the bot
Join: A user (perhaps us) joined a channel
Part: A user (perhaps us) left a channel
Nick: A user (perhaps us) changed their nick
Notice: We recieved a Notice
Quit: A user (perhaps us) quit the server
Kick: A user (perhaps us) was kicked from a channel
Topic: A user changed the channel topic
Invite: We were invited to a channel
All: Catches all events, and gets provided the event type called

Simple example bot (Only responds to help actions)

<?php
require_once('SquealCallbackSchedule.php');
require_once('SquealChannel.php');
require_once('SquealCommandListener.php');
require_once('SquealHelpCommandListener.php');
require_once('SquealIrcBot.php');

require_once('SquealUser.php');

$bot = new SquealIrcBot();
$bot->addEventListener(new SquealHelpCommandListener());
$bot->connect('chat.freenode.net');
$bot->joinChannel('#squeal_bot');
$bot->runBot();
