SquealIrcBot is an IRC bot framework written in php that is designed to help
create new bots quickly and run them efficiently. It was built by Cullen Walsh,
who was tired of having to use frameworks in other languages (Java...) to build
IRC bots.

SquealIrcBot is based on / a port of PircBot, which is a GPL IRC bot library
written in Java and available at http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php .
